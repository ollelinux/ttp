    Test Task

    # PROBLEM STATEMENT

    “Marryat Hotels” needs a Property Management System to operate their hotel
    business. Your task is to define and implement a backend REST API using the
    Python programming language. The API should provide functionality to do
    following:

    1. CRUD Reservations
    2. Search Reservations by date range (e.g. get reservations from 15 to 19 July
       2017)

    Reservation is a first-class citizen of the system. Reservation entity
    contains: first & last name of the guest, room number, start date and end date of
    the stay.


    # IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

    Please follow these rules for your solution:

    1. Use Python as a programming language.
    2. Distribute application as a docker image via hub.docker.com
    3. Share the code via github.com

    You’re also encouraged to use any third-party libraries and frameworks, which may
    simplify you work.

    When posting the code to Github, keep in mind we prefer some commits history in
    the repo vs single commit. Tests are welcome and encouraged.

    Good luck!
